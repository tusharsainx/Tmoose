App Idea: "Moodify"
Purpose:
Moodify leverages Spotify APIs to analyze a user’s listening history, favorite tracks, and playlists. It then suggests personalized playlists based on their current mood, activities, or specific genres they want to explore.

Key Features:

Mood-Based Playlists:

Users select their current mood (e.g., happy, sad, relaxed, energetic).
The app curates a playlist that matches this mood, using Spotify’s audio features like tempo, energy, and valence.
Daily Mood Tracker:

The app tracks daily listening habits and moods, offering insights into how music affects the user’s mood over time.
Users can see a "Mood Calendar" where they can view how their musical tastes and moods have changed over days or weeks.
Activity-Based Playlists:

Users can choose an activity (e.g., working out, studying, relaxing).
The app suggests a playlist tailored to that activity, considering tempo, intensity, and genre.
Discover New Music:

The app suggests new artists or tracks outside the user’s usual listening habits, based on their mood and activity preferences.
Users can also explore music that other users with similar moods or activities are listening to.
Social Sharing:

Users can share their mood-based playlists on social media or with friends.
The app can create collaborative mood-based playlists with friends who are in a similar mood or doing the same activity.
Integration with Spotify:

The app uses Spotify's Web API to fetch user data, such as top tracks, recent playlists, and favorite genres.
The app can directly add recommended songs or playlists to the user’s Spotify account.
Problem Solved:
Many users struggle to find the right music for their mood or activity. Moodify simplifies this by providing personalized, mood-based playlists, helping users discover new music that resonates with them emotionally or enhances their activities. It adds an emotional layer to music discovery that many apps don't focus on.
